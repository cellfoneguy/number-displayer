/* 
 *
 * Lab 2a: Testing
 *
 * This SystemVerilog file (and associated benchXX.sve file) contain a 
 * set of "buggy" black-box modules that you will test for bugs. Your 
 * task is to systematically test the modules and tell us which modules 
 * contain the bugs and what they are.
 *
 * Note: you may NOT modify any of the modules named "Adder",
 * "Subtractor", or "Comparator". ALL OF YOUR TEST CODE MUST GO INTO THE
 * "test_design" MODULE!!
 * 
 * The correct functionality of the top-level circuit is:
 * 
 *    out = (a + b) < (c - d)
 *
